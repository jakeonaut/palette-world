todo:
    1. -don't need to re-get original pixels/tiles from the first image every time you repalette??
    2. two color selection modes:
      a. pick closest color
      b. clump all pixels into distinct chunks of number = number of colors in palette
        -then recolor every color chunk to one distinct color from the palette
          -choose the chunk that is closest to any color first, remove that color from palette, repeat

    4. allow custom palette selection (using color selector)
