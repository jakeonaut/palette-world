    1. -clump colors in a tile into as many distinct "colors" as there are colors in the palette
        -then, get the average color value of each of these "color clumps"
        -now, select a distinct color from the 'palette' for each individual color clump for conversion
    2. -don't need to re-get original pixels/tiles from the first image every time you repalette??
